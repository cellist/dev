This is a slightly more advanced example, level 2, so to say ...
Now cmake has to deal with more than one source file.

With this, I am also familiarizing myself with the Standard Template
Library concepts again, after several years of no involvement in any
practical C++ development. I have to confess this is also a recap of
OOP in C++ for me :blush:.

To get this going, do:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
