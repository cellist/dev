A long-time Makefile user, I am now familiarizing myself with the very
useful
[cmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html)
tool. I am trying this utility while recapping some fundamental topics
of C/C++ programming (and not limited to that, of course!) like
debugging, profiling, logging, unit testing, code coverage, and memory
checking.

Furthermore, this is also my first hands-on with the Clang compiler
suite, coming from the GNU compiler collection. At the moment my work
horse is the Debian "Buster" Linux distribution I use under
[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), in
combination with
[RDP](https://dev.to/darksmile92/linux-on-windows-wsl-with-desktop-environment-via-rdp-522g)
actually.

I am not giving the setup instructions, e.g. explaining the required
packages for my experiments thouroughly, as these would be different
for your OS and IDE of choice anyways, however most of the small
projects are accompanied by a *go.sh* script that hopefully briefly
tells you what my intentions were.
